# ðŸŒŸ NEON PURPLE PRO THEME

## Overview
An exclusive, **fully immersive neon purple theme** for PRO users that transforms the entire SSDT application into a glowing purple wonderland!

## What Was Implemented

### 1. UserContext System
**File:** `frontend/src/contexts/UserContext.jsx`
- Created a global context to track user PRO status across the entire app
- Automatically fetches user profile on app load
- Provides `isPro` boolean to all components
- Auto-refreshes when user authentication changes

### 2. Neon Purple Theme System
**File:** `frontend/src/styles/ProTheme.scss`
- **Comprehensive CSS override system** that affects EVERYTHING
- Over 400 lines of custom neon purple styling
- Works in both **light and dark modes**

#### What Gets Purpled:
âœ¨ **Backgrounds:** All gradients from deep purple to bright purple
âœ¨ **Buttons:** Neon purple with glowing effects and hover animations
âœ¨ **Cards & Containers:** Purple borders with neon glow shadows
âœ¨ **Headers:** Purple gradient backgrounds with glowing text
âœ¨ **Inputs & Forms:** Purple borders with glow effects
âœ¨ **Badges & Labels:** Animated pulsing purple badges
âœ¨ **Links:** Purple with glow on hover
âœ¨ **Tables:** Purple borders and hover effects
âœ¨ **Scrollbars:** Purple with glow effects
âœ¨ **Modals:** Purple borders with strong glow

#### Special Features:

- **Box Shadow Glows:** Everything has purple glow effects
- **Gradient Backgrounds:** Multi-layer purple gradients throughout
- **Text Shadows:** All headings have purple glow text shadows
- **Hover Effects:** Enhanced glow on hover interactions

### 3. Dark Mode Support
**Target:** `body.dark .pro-theme`
- Deep space purple backgrounds (#0a0118 â†’ #2d1b4e)
- Extra dark purple cards for contrast
- Bright purple text for readability

### 4. Light Mode Support
**Target:** `body.light .pro-theme`
- Pastel purple backgrounds (#f3e8ff â†’ #ddd6fe)
- Dark purple text for readability
- Maintained neon effects with adjusted colors

### 5. PRO Badge in Header
**File:** `frontend/src/components/header.jsx`
- Added `useUser()` hook to header
- Shows animated "PRO âš¡" badge next to Profile button
- Pulsing neon purple animation
- Only visible when user is PRO

### 6. App Integration
**File:** `frontend/src/App.js`
- Wrapped app with `UserProvider`
- Created `AppContent` component that reads `isPro` status
- Applies `.pro-theme` class to entire app when user is PRO
- Seamless integration with existing `ThemeProvider`

### 7. CSS Import
**File:** `frontend/src/index.js`
- Added ProTheme.scss import
- Loads globally for all components

## Color Palette

### Dark Mode Colors
```scss
--neon-purple-primary: #a855f7
--neon-purple-bright: #c084fc
--neon-purple-dark: #7c3aed
--neon-purple-darker: #6d28d9
--neon-purple-bg: #1a0b2e
--neon-purple-bg-light: #2d1b4e
--neon-purple-bg-lighter: #3d2b5e

--neon-purple-text-bright: #4c1d95
```

## How It Works

1. **User logs in** â†’ UserContext fetches profile
2. **Profile includes `isPro: true`** â†’ UserContext sets `isPro = true`
3. **App.js reads `isPro`** â†’ Applies `pro-theme` class to wrapper div
4. **ProTheme.scss activates** â†’ All `.pro-theme` styles override defaults
5. **Everything turns purple!** ðŸŸ£âœ¨
